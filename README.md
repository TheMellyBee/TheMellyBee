- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheMellyBee
- 👀 I’m a Senior AI/ML Architect, experienced in genAI, knowledge graphs, NLP, traditional ML, and data science.
- 🗺️ Network Science is my jam... digital twins, graphRAG, graph db.. you name! I think they give critical insights we wouldn't otherwise see. 
- 🌱 Always learning something new in AI/ML, fiber arts, etc. 
- 💞️ I'm always open for collaborations particularly with non-profits in tasks that help others or learn about our planet. I've previously collabrated for Tech Against Trafficking.
